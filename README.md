|  **Lightning Network** |  **Scalable, Instant Bitcoin/Blockchain Transactions** <br> Lightning is a decentralized network using smart contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant payments across a network of participants. | - [Lightning Network Summary](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-summary.pdf) <br> - [The Bitcoin Lightning Network](https://cryptochainuni.com/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-lightning-network-paper-DRAFT-0.5.pdf) <br> - [Lightning Network Paper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) <br> -[LND Doc](https://docs.lightning.engineering/)   | - [Apresentation Bitcoin Lightning Network](https://cointhinktank.com/upload/crypto/lightning-network.pdf) <br> - [A Lightning Network da Bitcoin, explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrr_zPmEiME&ab_channel=SimplyExplained)   |[-Explanation Lightning Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKdK-7AtAMQ) <br> [-Deep Dive Lightning Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8XItlplac) |
|  **Layer 1 Solutions** | Layer-1 scaling solutions augment the base layer of the blockchain protocol itself in order to improve scalability.<br><br> - **Sharding :** Sharding is the process of splitting a database horizontally to spread the load. In an Ethereum context, sharding will reduce network congestion and increase transactions per second by creating new chains, known as “shards.” <br><br> - **Consensus protocol improvements:** Some consensus mechanisms are more efficient than others.  | - [Shard chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) <br> - [What is Sharding?](https://academy.bit2me.com/pt/o-que-%C3%A9-sharding/) <br> - [Proof-of-Stake](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/staking-rewards-pos-blockchains) <br> -[Sharding FAQ by Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/31/sharding_faq.html#what-is-the-basic-idea-behind-sharding)  | - [What is sharding?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AtGrwSN8Nc&ab_channel=IDGTECHtalk) <br> -[Vitalik talking about sharding e rollups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuMOQAVpI2c&ab_channel=LexClips)  | |
|  **Layer 2 Solutions** | Layer-2 refers to a network or technology that operates on top of an underlying blockchain protocol to improve its scalability and efficiency. <br> <br> - **Commit chains:** A nested blockchain is essentially a blockchain within — or, rather, atop — another blockchain. The nested blockchain architecture typically involves a main blockchain that sets parameters for a broader network, while executions are undertaken on an interconnected web of secondary chains. <br> <br> - **Rollups:** ZK-Rollups are one of the options being developed for layer 2 construction that increases scalability through mass transfer processing rolled into a single transaction.  |  -[Scaling](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/) <br> - **Commit chains:** <br> 1.[Polygon](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/polygon-crypto-matic-network-dapps-erc20-token) <br> 2.[Commit-Chain Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/642.pdf) <br> 3.[Plasma Paper](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf)<br> **- Rollups:** <br> 1.[Rollup Ecosystem](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/layer-2-scaling-zk-rollup-optimistic-rollup-ethereum)  | - [Polygon Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IijtdpAtOt0&ab_channel=Finematics) <br> -[Explaining solutions of Layer 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgCgauWVTs0&ab_channel=Finematics)  | |

| **Solana**  | Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. Founded in 2017, Solana is an open-source project currently run by Solana Foundation based in Geneva, while the blockchain was built by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.Solana is much faster in terms of the number of transactions it can process and has significantly lower transaction fees compared to rival blockchains like Ethereum.  | -[Solana Whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)  | -[Solana Course](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course)   | [What is Solana? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzROE6EhxM&ab_channel=WhiteboardCrypto) |
